	Hurray! Chef got his first internship. Chef was recruited for JAVA-coder profile. Everyone is aware of chef's excellent 
	cooking skills , but little does anybody know, that he recently started coding.

	Today is his first day at work and he was given the following task for the day:
	There are T number of java programs and chef has to convert each final variable to a normal variable in each program.

	Chef can identify final variables with the help of final keyword and give them to you. Your task would be to convert them
	into "camel cased" variables and give the output to chef.

	Note: 
	i.) Final variables can contain: all uppercase letters [A-Z] using a single underscore to separate words.
	ii.) Camel cased variables can contain: only starting letter as lowercase and if the variable name has two or more words 
	they are combined with their starting letter in uppercase.
