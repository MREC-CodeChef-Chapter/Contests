    Problem name: Paired Run                | Problem Code: PRUN22

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


	A paired running race event is being conducted in your college. After several rounds of filtering we have 2 teams left TeamA and
	TeamB. Each team member of both teams were asked to randomly pick up some character label from the Magic Box. 
	Now before the paired run begins each member of TeamA must be paired with each member of TeamB which is cross-pairing. 
	If after all the pairings are done and still some members are left in any of the teams then self-pairing is done. 
	In self pairing, members of the same team can be paired if and only if they have similar character labels.

	Now since you are a volunteer, your task is to pair up all the members and gather some information. Incase all the members are 
	paired up you need to print number of teams you could finally form. And if even a single member is left out you must print -1;

Input Format:

   The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
   The first line of each test case contains a string denoting TeamA members.
   The second line of each test case contains another string denoting TeamB members.
   
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Output Format:

	If atleast one person was left out and couldn't form a pair then print -1 on a new line. Else print the number of pairs that were
formed on a new line.

Constraints:

  1<=T<=10000
  1<=|TeamA|,|TeamB|<=1000

NOTE: Both the strings contain only uppercase english alphabets.

Sample Input1:

3
AABBCC
AABBCC
ABCXYZ
XYZABC
ABMNA
BMMN

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sample Output1:

6
6
-1

Explanation:

Explanation of the third sample case: 

Here,
A goes for self pairing. A-A
B goes for cross pairing. B-B
N goes for cross pairing. N-N
Since there are 3 M's we even if we try to pair 2 of them M-M , there is always atleast one M left out. Hence print -1;
